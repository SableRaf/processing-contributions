        Thank you for your new library contribution to Processing!

        If you need help creating a library, see the [Library Guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Library-Guidelines) or ask on the [Processing Forum](https://discourse.processing.org/).

        Once you submit this form, the `library.properties` file at the provided URL will be parsed and validated.

        The result of this validation will be added to this issue:
        - If valid, a pull request will automatically be created to add your library to the repository.
        - If invalid, a comment will be added with details of the error. You will need to fix the file and resubmit.
