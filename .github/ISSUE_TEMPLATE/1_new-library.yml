        Thank you for your new library contribution to Processing!

        Libraries are add-ons that extend the functionality of the Processing language ([read more](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Library-Overview)).

        If you need help creating a library, see the [Library Guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Library-Guidelines) or ask on the [Processing Forum](https://discourse.processing.org/).

        Please complete the form below with the necessary information about your library.

        ### About the `.txt` File

        The `.txt` file (e.g., `myLibrary.txt`) is necessary for submitting your library. It should be a direct copy of your `library.properties` file, hosted in the same directory as your `.zip` distribution, and share the same base name.

        **Example:**
        If your release artifacts are hosted at `https://mywebsite.com/releases/latest/`, ensure these files are available:
        - `.txt` file: `https://mywebsite.com/releases/latest/myLibrary.txt`
        - `.zip` file: `https://mywebsite.com/releases/latest/myLibrary.zip`

        For more details, see the [Release Artifacts section of the Library Guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing4/wiki/Library-Guidelines#release-artifacts).

        Once you submit this form, the `.txt` file at the provided URL will be parsed and validated.

        The result of this validation will be added to this issue:
        - If valid, a pull request will automatically be created to add your library to the repository.
        - If invalid, a comment will be added with details of the error. You will need to fix the file and resubmit.
