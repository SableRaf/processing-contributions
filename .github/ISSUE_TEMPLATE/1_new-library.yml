        Once you submit this form, the `.txt` file at the provided URL will be parsed and validated.

        The result of this validation will be added to this issue:
        - If valid, a pull request will automatically be created to add your library to the repository.
        - If invalid, a comment will be added with details of the error. You will need to fix the file and resubmit.
