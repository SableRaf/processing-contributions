        Thank you for your contribution to Processing!

        Modes, also called language modes, allow Processing users to code and run sketches in different code languages and on different platforms ([read more](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Mode-Overview)).

        If you need help creating a mode, see the [Mode Overview](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Mode-Overview) or ask on the [Processing Forum](https://discourse.processing.org/).

        Once you submit this form, the `mode.properties` file at the provided URL will be parsed and validated.

        The result of this validation will be added to this issue:
        - If valid, a pull request will automatically be created to add your mode to the repository.
        - If invalid, a comment will be added with details of the error. You will need to fix the file and resubmit.
